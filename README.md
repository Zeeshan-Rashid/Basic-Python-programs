# Basic Python Projects

in this Project we are going to do Basic programs of Python
List of Python Programs 
1. Write a Program(WAP) to display the statement: Hello World, Welcome to Python
Programming.
2. Write a Program to read and store your roll no, name, and address in three different
variables and print all the contents of variables on screen.
3. WAP to calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle.
4. WAP to calculate the area and circumference of a circle.
5. WAP to read the principle, rate of interest, and the number of years and calculate the simple
interest.
6. WAP to read the marks of 5 subjects and calculate the sum and percentage of marks
obtained by a student.
7. WAP to read the temperature in Celsius and convert it into Fahrenheit.
8. WAP to find whether a number is Even or Odd.
9. WAP to find the greatest between two numbers.
10. WAP to find the greatest among three numbers.
11. WAP to find the greatest among three numbers using logical operators.
12. WAP to print 1 to n natural numbers.
13. WAP to find the sum of n natural numbers using loops.
14. WAP to find the reverse of a number entered.
15. WAP to find the sum of the digits of a given number.
16. WAP to count the total number of digits in a given number.
17. WAP to find the factorial of a number using loops.
18. WAP to generate multiplication table using loops.
19. WAP to generate different patterns.
20. WAP to create a function that takes two arguments, name and age, and prints their value.
21. WAP to create function Addition () such that it can accept two variables and returns the
addition of two variables.
22. WAP to create function calculation () such that it can accept two variables and calculate
addition, subtraction, and multiplication. Also, it must return addition, subtraction, and
multiplication in a single return call.
23. Write a Python function to find the Minimum of two numbers.
24. Write a Python function to calculate the factorial of a number (a non-negative integer). The
function accepts the number as an argument.
